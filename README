The Gugusse Roller is the second machine to transfer film to digital that
I've created and built.

For the moment the project is still under development, there is a lot
of information available on the Gugusse Roller Facebook page.

The Gugusse Roller uses a Raspberry Pi and the 8MP Raspberry Pi Camera V2,
the objectives of the software is to:
    -Drive the 3 stepper motors
    -read the 3 discrete inputs:
        1. film hole detector
        2. left arm aligned in middle
        3. right arm aligned in middle
    -capture each frame, save it as jpeg.
